# Sorry&#8482; Status Bar Plugin [![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/sorry-app/status-bar.svg)]()

In an effort to help extend your voice beyond the status page, we’ve put together this Status Bar plugin. 

Once dropped into your website or application it'll broadcast your [Sorry&#8482;](http://www.sorryapp.com) status updates direct to your users.

## Installing The Plugin

### Simply Include the JavaScript 

Just before the closing ```</ body>``` tag. You can specify which pages you want updates to be sourced from by including your Page ID in the `data-for` attribute.

```html
<script src="//code.sorryapp.com/status-bar/4.latest/status-bar.min.js" data-for="xxxxxxx"></script>
```

#### Not sure what your Page ID is?

If the address of your status page is ```http://xxxxxx.sorryapp.com``` then ```xxxxxxx``` is what you need to use as the data attribute. This unique ID can also be found in the browsers address bar within the app. ```https://app.sorryapp.com/pages/xxxxx```

#### Alternate location of your bar

By default the plugin will add the bar to the top of your page. To choose a specific location instead of using the ```data-for``` attribute as above, include the following HTML snippet in your page where you wish the bar to be located.

```html
<div class="sorry-status-bar" data-status-bar-for="xxxxxxx"></div>
```

## Prevent Readers from Dismissing Notices

If you'd rather notices **always** be displayed, rather than allowing your audience to dismiss those they've read you can add an additional data attribute to the script tag, which will remove the `x` icon from the notice.

```
<script ... data-dismissible="false" />
```

## Filtering the Notices

Sometimes you'll not want to display all open notices using the plugin, you'll want to limit it to perhaps only display 'planned' notices, or only those notices affecting a particular component of your service.

We have two `data-attributes=""` which you can include on the `<script />` tag, or the `<div />` if using an [alternate location for your bar](#alternate-location-of-your-bar).

#### Filter by Notice Type

`<script/div ... data-filter-type="planned/unplanned" />` will ensure only notices of a given type are displayed using the plugin. Display multiple types by passing them in this attribute as a comma separated list.

#### Filter by Affected Component

`<script/div ... data-filter-components="999" />` will ensure notices will only be displayed if they directly affect this particular component. If this components related parents, or one it's children are affected by a notice, the notice will also be displayed. Pass multiple components as a comma separated list.

**To find the ID of a component, browse to the 'components' section in the Sorry&#8482; UI, choose to edit the given component and you'll find it's ID in the URL.**

## Displaying as a Subscriber

If you have personal details about your user, it's possible to configure the plugin to see open notices through their eyes, registering them as a subscriber in your account, and only displaying notices they want to see.

To do this you need to define their details like so, **before you include the status-bar.js**.

```html
<script>
    window.SorryAPIOptions = {
        subscriber: {
            email: "robrawlins@gmail.com"
            first_name: "Robert",
            last_name: "Rawlins",
            nickname: "Rob",
            company: "Sorry™",
            component_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4]
        }
    }
</script>
```

### What data can I pass?

As a minimum you'll need to provider the subscribers email address, but you can also pass a bunch of other personal data to help you identify them, and even choose which components they're subscribed too. (Established plan only)

[Read the subscriber API documentation about all the attributes you can pass.](https://docs.sorryapp.com/api/v1/reference/pages/subscribers/index.html#the-subscriber-object)

## Keep Up To Date

If you want to always have the latest version of the plugin, we offer a source which will always give you the latest minor or patch version without you having to lift a finger. We don't offer an auto-updating source for major releases as these often break backwards compatibity.

Instead of the sources above, use these paths for the latest versions:

    //code.sorryapp.com/status-bar/4.latest/status-bar.min.js

Whilst minor/patch releases should not break backwards compatibility, it's still worth noting that there is always a risk involved in auto-updates like this - so use at your own peril.

## Styling The Plugin

If you want to custom style your widget, you only need create your own CSS. To help you understand how to style it the markup for the widget is based loosely on the [Twitter Bootstrap Alert](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#alerts), and looks like this:

```html
<div class="sorry-status-notice sorry-status-notice-{{notice.type}} sorry-status-notice-{{notice.state}}" id="sorry-status-notice-{{notice.id}}" role="alert">
    <button type="button" class="sorry-status-notice-close" data-dismiss="status-notice" aria-hidden="true">
        <i class="sorry-status-notice-icon sorry-status-notice-icon-times-circle"></i>
    </button>

    <div class="sorry-status-notice-content">
        <div class="sorry-status-notice-details">
            <h4 class="sorry-status-notice-header">
                <i class="sorry-status-notice-icon sorry-status-notice-icon-bullhorn"></i> {{lookup text.states notice.state}}
            </h4>
            <p class="sorry-status-notice-text">
                <time datetime="{{notice.begins_at}}" class="sorry-status-notice-schedule">{{moment notice.begins_at format="MMM Do, h:mma"}}</time> {{update.content}}
            </p>
        </div>
        <a class="sorry-status-notice-link" href="{{notice.link}}" target="_blank" title="{{text.links.more.title}}">{{text.links.more.text}} &#8594;</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Contributing To The Plugin

If you want to create your own custom build, or contribute to the project it’s important you know how our build and release process works.

This project uses Grunt with convenient methods for working with the project. It's how we compile our code, run tests, and more. To use it, install the required dependencies as directed and then run some Grunt commands.

### Install Grunt

From the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root `/sorry-announce` directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at [package.json](package.json) and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.

### Available Grunt commands

#### Build - `grunt`
Run `grunt` to run tests locally and compile the CSS and JavaScript into `/dist`.

#### Release a new version - `grunt release <:patch | :minor | :major>`
grunt release bumps the [version number](#versioning) and creates a new git tag. You’ll need write access to the repository for this to work.

You can append the release command with patch, minor or major depending on the version number increment you wish to make.

#### Deploy the latest version. - `grunt publish`
We use AWS S3 to host the assets on code.sorryapp.com. Running this command will push the latest build to S3, creating various copies in the `/x.x.latest.js` names, and clear all the appropriate CloudFront distributions.

#### Watch - `grunt watch`
This is a convenience method for watching all the core HTML, CSS and JS assets in the project, rebuilding if they change.

### Troubleshooting dependencies

Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, rerun `npm install`.

### Disable error logging

We log all errors within the plugin to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) using [Raven-JS](https://docs.sentry.io/clients/javascript/) so we can keep an eye on the plugin when it's in the field. However during development we don't want these errors logged.

We have a data attribute `<script ... data-environment="development" />` which when set will suppress errors being sent to Sentry, but they'll still be logged in the browsers developer console.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, This project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
